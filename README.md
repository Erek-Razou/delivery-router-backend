The backend of an excercise for the preparation of 5th Serres Tech Hackathon

## About
Technical Problem : 
You are responsible for developing a prototype application that drivers of waste collector vehicles (dustbin lorries) will use to suggest the shortest route when picking-up and transporting rubbish to the central waste management location.

You shall assume that all dustbins are located in 8 different villages and have to be collected. All lorries start from a central depot in Serres, and need to transfer the waste to "Adelfiko". The exact location of the dustbins in each village can be found in the table below.

The available routes to the other villages are depicted in the following graph. All routes are considered for this problem are two way streets.
